# About Me

Hi! I'm Alaric. I'm on a journey to get gud at coding and maybe get a job doing something besides making pizzas. At the moment I'm particularly interested in making games in Rust.

## Links 

### [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/alaricthefool)
I'm mainly active on Twitch, where I livestream myself working on projects from
around 7PM to 11PM PST.

### [Game Ideas](GAME_IDEAS.md)

I keep list of ideas for Games I want to make. They're mostly there to remind myself but I'm not the type
to care about idea theft or anything like that. So if you're looking for some inspiration and want to steal
one of them, help yourself! I'd really enjoy a link if anyone ever did make anything based off one of my
silly ideas.
