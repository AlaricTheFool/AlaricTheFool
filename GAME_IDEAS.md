# Game Ideas
What follows is a list of game ideas that have been kicking around in my head
long enough that I don't want to forget about them.

I particularly love roguelike mechanics, card games, and management sims, so
expect to see those themes repeat a lot. I'm also quite interested in 
multiplayer game design, but that's a whole can of worms that I haven't yet
managed to open.

I don't care for intellectual property so if one of these ideas speak to you,
feel free to steal! Honestly I'm just happy if good games exist and I don't 
really care if I'm the one to make them or not.

## Raid Night

A 1 vs 3 card game where the solo player takes on the role of a final boss in an
mmo style fantasy dungeon and the team of 3 players are the different members of
the holy trinity (tank/healer/dps) facing off against them.

I've always been really excited by things like MTG's Nemesis mode or the WoW
TCG's Raid decks, and it always bummed me out that these were just spin-off
modes of the main game. They usually don't receive much support and it feels
like such a waste of interesting design space.

My dream for this project would be an actual competitive card game, but there
are definite logistical issues. 4 Players in a TCG means way way more complexity
compared to a 2-player game like Magic or Hearthstone. I've thought about it and
even made a few prototypes, but it's tricky.

An alternative would be to do something like a single-player version of the same
idea where you play just the boss holding out against AI opponents in a more 
roguelike deckbuilder-type gameplay loop. Seeing as sorting out the multiplayer
infrastructure for a card game would be a big challenge for a solo dev.

## Scrap Towers

Up on the high hills of a fantastical land, the humans live in a luxurious
castle where the king and queen live out their happily ever after. These humans
take their waste and toss it into **The Scrap Pit**, a massive ravine where all
manner of beasts make their homes away from the humans.

In The Scrap Pit lives a certain tribe of particularly inventive goblins,
masters of making gadgets and gizmos out of the trash they find lying around.
The new king of these goblins has had enough of living in the human kingdom's
shadow, so they decide to wage war.

### Gameplay

This is some sort of tower defense game where the primary draw is the ability to
build your towers out of various mix-and-match component parts your goblins gather.
Depending on the parts you fit together, you can create the sorts of towers you'd
see in a more traditional TD games, or with stranger combinations you may end up
with something weirder.

As an example, if you combined a **Fire Hose** barrel with **Oil** as ammunition
and attached a **Lit Torch** as well, you would have a traditional flamethrower
type tower. But maybe if you remove the lit torch and swap out the fire hose for
a large cannon barrel, your tower would shoot giant globs of sticky tar.

Idunno.

The main appeal would be the feeling of wondering "What would happen if I put together X and Y"
and then finding out.

## Princess of Monsters

A young woman from a city of monster hunters befriends a cerberus puppy and runs away from home
into the depths of the dark forest, where terrible beasts of all kinds are said to roam. There,
she finds a shrine to the **Queen of Monsters**, a character known as a terrible witch in local
folklore who first turned the beasts of the woods against the city. But the forest shrine paints
a different picture of a woman who only wished to care for the beasts of the woods and was attacked
by the city folk.

The young woman decides to follow in the Queen's footsteps, becoming the Princess of Monsters. She,
together with her Cerberus companion, begins to build up a castle and care for more and more creatures.
But the people of the city won't allow her to live peacefully, and begin to attack in greater and greater numbers.

### Gameplay

My mental image of this game is a sort of Stardew Valley type farming/home-steading simulator combined with
strategy elements to defend your land from invaders. For much of the time, you feed and tend to various cute
spins on traditional monsters, using their help to grow food for them and build up a little settlement. But
when enemies come to attack you, the monsters turn to more traditional frightening forms and you control them
to fend off invaders.

## The MMO Idea

Of course I want to make an mmo. The genre has barely grown or evolved since WoW. I want to make one with
Permadeath elements lmao. Something fresh and interesting that lets you actually fulfill some of the
promises made by saying a game is a "Massively multiplayer fantasy world where you can become a great hero".
Because I don't think the games right now really fulfill that promise.
